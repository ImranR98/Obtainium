**Prerequisites**
<!-- Please ensure your request is not part of an existing issue. -->

**Describe the feature**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

For new Sources, it's preferable (not required) if you suggest how the following details can be extracted from the Source in a reliable way (like an API or through web scraping):
- The App version (or any release-specific identifier - a "pseudo-version") for the latest release
- One or more APK URL(s) for the latest release
- Above details for previous releases (optional)

Note that the Web scraper cannot deal with JavaScript-enabled content. -->

**Describe alternatives you've considered (if applicable)**
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

Note that app-specific Sources are less likely to be added. In those cases, see if the HTML Source will work for you (if not, see if a generally-applicable enhancement to the HTML Source would work, and suggest that instead). -->

**Additional context**
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->
